## Design choices

First of all, I chose achromatic color as the main design color, Because it is to give a clean and simple feeling.
So I spent a lot of time choosing the background image of the landing page. It was not easy to choose a neat stock photo that matched achromatic color.
In order to avoid monotony, very light letters were placed in the background to give a natural decorative effect.

## Function
- nacbar and background characters
In the CSS, I fixed the positions of them, and also controled the value of z-index.
For the navbar, the z-index value was set to 100 and placed first, while for the background letter, the z-index value was set to -100 and placed to be last.

- Fade Function
I used 'npm install react-fade-in' to use this function.  
Each title had a 'fade' effect.
